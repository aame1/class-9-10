### Hi everyone!
My name is **Adek Impianna** and I am **Indonesian**. Please just call me _**Yana**_.  
Do not worry, Impianna is not my family name! In Indonesia, we are not really obliged to include a family name in our name. So Impianna is totally my name, not my father's or the father before him :sweat_smile:.  

### More about me  
I speak fluently **Indonesian and English**, _ik spreek ook een klein beetje Nederlands et j'essaie même de parler français mais c'est pas facile du tout!_  
I firstly **came to Belgium to study** and I recently finished my studies in _Business Management at VUB_ in Brussels.
But a litte bit before that, I worked in **Bali** for 2 years which was _the best time of my life!_ :relaxed:  
Now I live in **Boortmeerbeek** (a small town in _between Mechelen and Leuven_), thus I am gonna see you once or twice at the train station.  

I like to :
* **play video games**, but I am not interested in a war or fight related game, I play mostly **strategic games**.
* **cook and eat** with friends, mostly Indonesian food but why not try something new and other food as well, right?  
* learn and **find out something new**, like how to make illustrations, how to open a business, how to make a masker without sewing machine?, etc. :sunglasses:
